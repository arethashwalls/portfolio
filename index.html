            <p class="your-text">Who are you?</p>

            <p class="my-text">Hi there! I'm Aretha Walls, a full-stack web developer located in Tucson,
                Arizona.</p>
            <p class="my-text">I graduated from the University of Arizona in May of 2017 with Bachelor of Arts degrees
                in Linguistics and Philosophy, with a focus on Ethics. By the time I had graduated, I was confident
                that a lifetime of academia wasn’t for me.</p>
            <p class="my-text">I began working full-time for a local digital public relations firm, Ridgewood
                Associates, the day after graduation. My position focused on support at first, but when you work for
                a very small company, you wind up taking on all kinds of tasks. I started working with Ridgewood’s
                web-master a few months into the job and found I enjoyed writing the brief snippets of code assigned to
                me more than I expected.</p>
            <p class="my-text">I had taken a few computer science courses on a whim in college, but coding for the web
                felt different. I could create usable, visually appealing applications after a few weeks of study—a far
                cry from Intro to CS, where we were told not to touch GUI libraries until the end of the first
                semester.</p>
            <p class="my-text">Over the next few months, I became very comfortable writing HTML and CSS, and began
                dipping my toes in the wide ocean of JavaScript. In the summer of 2018, I learned that Ridgewood would
                be going out of business in December. I figured it was time to sink or swim and decided to enroll in
                the University of Arizona’s Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p class="my-text">I’m currently neck-deep in an intense, six-month full-stack curriculum and loving it.</p>

            <p class="your-text">What do you do?</p>
