                    Hi there! I'm Aretha, a full-stack web developer located in Tucson, Arizona.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of Arizona in May of 2017 with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Linguistics and Philosophy, with a focus on Ethics. By the time I had graduated, I was confident that a lifetime of academia wasn’t for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began working full-time the day after graduation. My position was support-focused on paper, but when you work for a very small company, you wind up taking on all kinds of tasks, and I started writing small  snippets of code here and there for the websites we produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had taken a few computer science courses on a whim in college, but coding for the web felt different. I could  create usable, visually appealing applications after a few weeks of studying. When I learned that my company would be going out of business in December, I figured it was time to sink or swim and decided to enroll in the University of Arizona’s Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past six months, I’ve developed over 25 applications, gained and sharpened new technical skills, and, most importantly, learned how to fail early, learn quickly, and build collaboratively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I have a minute to breath, I’m a voracious reader, a table-top gamer, a casual artist, and an obsessive sci-fi world-builder.
