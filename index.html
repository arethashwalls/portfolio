                        <p>
                            Hi there! I'm Aretha, a full-stack web developer located in Tucson, Arizona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I graduated from the University of Arizona in May of 2017 with Bachelor of Arts degrees in
                            Linguistics and Philosophy, with a focus on Ethics. By the time I had graduated, I was
                            confident that a lifetime of academia wasn’t for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began working full-time the day after graduation. My position was support-focused on
                            paper, but when you work for a very small company, you wind up taking on all kinds of
                            tasks, and I started writing small snippets of code here and there for the websites we
                            produced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had taken a few computer science courses on a whim in college, but coding for the web
                            felt different. I could create usable, visually appealing applications after a few weeks of
                            studying. When I learned that my company would be going out of business in December, I
                            figured it was time to sink or swim and decided to enroll in the University of Arizona’s
                            Coding Bootcamp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the past six months, I’ve developed over 25 applications, gained and sharpened new
                            technical skills, and, most importantly, learned how to fail early, learn quickly, and
                            build collaboratively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I have a minute to breath, I’m a voracious reader, a table-top gamer, a casual artist,
                            and an obsessive sci-fi world-builder.
                        </p>
