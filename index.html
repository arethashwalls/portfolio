                <p class="my-text">Hi there! I'm Aretha, a full-stack web developer located in Tucson,
                    Arizona.
                    <br /><br />
                    I graduated from the University of Arizona in May of 2017 with Bachelor of Arts degrees
                    in Linguistics and Philosophy, with a focus on Ethics. By the time I had graduated, I was confident
                    that a lifetime of academia wasn’t for me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I began working full-time the day after graduation. My position was support-focused on paper, but
                    when you work for
                    a very small company, you wind up taking on all kinds of tasks, and I started writing small
                    snippets of code here and there for the websites we produced.
                    <br /><br />
                    I had taken a few computer science courses on a whim in college, but coding for the web
                    felt different. I could create usable, visually appealing applications after a few weeks of
                    studying.
                    <br /><br />
                    Over the next few months, I became very comfortable writing HTML and CSS and began
                    dipping my toes in the wide ocean of JavaScript. In the summer of 2018, I learned that my company
                    would
                    be going out of business in December. I figured it was time to sink or swim and decided to enroll
                    in
                    the University of Arizona’s Coding Bootcamp.
                    <br /><br />
                    I’m currently neck-deep in an intense, six-month full-stack curriculum and loving it.</p>

                    focuses on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, but I aim to develop a familiarity with
                    at least one
                    additional backend language. I am currently proficient with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am
                    comfortable
                    designing and implementing front-end sites with or without Bootstrap or JQuery.</p>
